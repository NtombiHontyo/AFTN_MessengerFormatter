# Overview

Creating software for real world problems is the basic job of a software engineer. The problem could be in any field. In the case of this project, it is in the world of Aviation.

As indicated above, this software is to enable some automation in the world aviation, particulary for Air Traffic Officers. The software creates an automating message formatter. It is written in the Java language using OOP.

Aviation is one of the few industries in which a small mistake can end up being a huge fatal catastrophe. There is little to no room for error. Sending messages to other Aerodromes must be done such that there is no ambiguity and in uniform style that all are customed to. This AFTN (Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network) message formatter will decrease the workload of ATSAs(Air Traffic Service Assistants) by taking care of the formatting of the message. All they have to do is answer the prompts accurately.

# Future Work



- Write the message onto another file and format
- Add other types of messages other than the three already there
- Add more conditions to ensure the user input is accurate and appropriate for the required field
